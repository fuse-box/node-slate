## A heroic bundler, that just does it right

FuseBox is a bundler/module loader that combines the power of webpack, JSPM and SystemJS. It is blazing fast (it takes 50-100ms to re-bundle) which makes it extremely convenient for developers. It requires zero configuration to bundle such monsters like `babel-core`, it will compile and bundle your typescript project within a fraction of a second, yet offering a comprehensive loader API. It is packed with features, and unfolds limitless possibilities of extending the API.
